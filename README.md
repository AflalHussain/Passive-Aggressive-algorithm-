# Passive-Aggressive-algorithm-


This project is an implementation and evaluation of Online Passive Aggressive algorithms with a benchmark dataset.
The journal paper on Online Passive Aggressive algorithm was thoroughly read and understood, then it was implemented from scratch using Octave(a higher level programming language) and evaluated with the benchmark dataset 'Breast Cancer WIS Consin dataset' from UCI Data Repository.
